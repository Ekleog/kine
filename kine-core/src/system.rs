/// Unfortunately, this means that on such systems it is basically impossible to have precise
/// time accounting during leap seconds. As such, even `Time::now()` may return wrong results
/// at these times, in a way similar to if the system clock were not set correctly.

/// could use a fallback clock (like `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`) during a leap seconds. Contributions
